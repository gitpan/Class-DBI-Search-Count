NAME
    Class::DBI::Search::Count - return count of results rather than results

SYNOPSIS
            use base 'Class::DBI';

            __PACKAGE__->add_searcher(
                    search_count => 'Class::DBI::Search::Count'
            );

            my $recent = CD->search_count(year => 2005);

    This is equivalent to, but, as the counting is done at the database
    rather than in perl, faster than:

      my $recent = CD->search(year => 2005)->count;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple search plugin for Class::DBI to return a count of
    results rather than the results themselves.

METHODS
  add_searcher
            __PACKAGE__->add_searcher(
                    method_name => 'Class::DBI::Search::Count'
            );

    As with all Search plugins you can choose the method name for the search
    that it generates.

  sql
    We override the SQL to be our own COUNT(*) version

  run_search
    We override this to return our count rather than the search results.
